# Sliders table

**Information**
  This repository contains an R script for visualizing, editing and downloading columns from an excel table. The columns will be normalized and the normalized values can be multiplied with the scores in the sliders. The resulting scores are multiplicated into the Score column, and the table can be exported.


**Usecase**
  <a href=https://sjbrou.github.io/postcode4_map/>GitHub Drawing maps based on postcode</a> works great in combination with this slider app to calculate and visualize data.
